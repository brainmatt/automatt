<h5>Features:</h5>

- simple UI-frontend based on Tk

- easy recording prompts for your next tasks

- lightweight server based on 'browser use' (https://github.com/browser-use) waiting for your to submit your tasks

- user-friendly CLI for continuous browser automation

- support for custom 'auto-login hooks' enables you to login to a specific website before the automation workflow starts which is super useful for e.g. QA/UAT test on login protected sites.

- custom model configuration and browser selection

- works on linux/Mac/Windows

- last but not least AutoMatt does not need a second browser such as 'browser use webui' (https://github.com/browser-use/web-ui)

<h5>Why it is named 'AutoMatt'?</h5>
So, my name is 'Matt' and I love automation because I am lazy as hell ...eh, I meant 'efficient' of course.
After seeing my work results for some while my boss gave me the nickname 'AutoMatt' and I lik it a lot. Thanks!

So I dedicated this little project to my favourite nickname.

<h5>Thanks</h5>
Many thanks and appreciation to the 'browser use' team! Keep up the great work!
